# Diploma on the topic: "Machine learning in the problem of predicting customer churn" #

### :memo: This paper focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company using machine learning. The whole difficulty of this work lies in working with unbalanced data contained in the data, in which prediction without special methods gives incorrect results. The theoretical part of this work outlines the basics of machine learning, the main classification algorithms, as well as methods for dealing with data imbalance and the corresponding metrics for determining the quality of models. In the practical part of this work, the use and application of various methods is shown to obtain more accurate models, hence more accurate prediction results.
